# A shell script to call your compiler. Please edit as you like to invoke
# your compiler in the appropriate way.
#
# This script needs to be able to take one argument with the path to the
# input Python file and produce a file containing the output x86 file,
# except that the suffix should be replaced with the .s suffix. For example,
# executing
#
# $ ./pyyc tests/test1.py
#
# should create an x86 assembly file tests/test1.s.

# THIS_DIR is bound to the directory that this script file is in.
